# You can save your tests into a file using:
# ./tests.sh > name_of_file.txt
# you can edit which executables to run on line 90.

###### DO NOT REMOVE - restoring permissions
# git will be unable to deal with files when we don't have permissions

# permissions after running the tests.

# chmod +(w / r) means 'give all users write / read permission for the file'

###### YOU CAN EDIT BELOW THIS POINT

# the run_test function has been incrementing both a counter for how many tests have run
# and a counter for passes. We will display this (along with a message for clarity).

# OPTIONAL - neither of these will affect your tests
# Many programmers prefer to work from a relatively 'tidy' directory
# and so will ensure any temp files created by the tests are removed
# and any object files are removed.

# remove the files we created during the tests
rm tmp null
# and run make clean to remove object files
